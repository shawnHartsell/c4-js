# hai_c4
A simple client-side Connect Four clone using ES6, React, Redux, and Webpack. This project serves as a reference implementation and will not be actively maintained.

### Depencies

* Node.JS (for npm)

### How to run

* ```npm install```
* ```npm run dev``` -> starts the app via webpack dev server

client code is bundled and put in __./dist__ (refer to webpack.config.js)

### How to play

* choose the size the grid
* make moves anywhere on the grid and try to get 4 in a row
  * the "no physics" feature was made at the request of my target audience i.e. my 5 year old :D
  
 Have Fun!
